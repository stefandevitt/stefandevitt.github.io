<div class="textbox3">
<p>For being such a small island, Rarotonga has so many cultural experiences to offer, from island flyovers, to boat crusises, to over water cultural shows and even a buggy ride through the mountainous range in the heart of the island. Three amazing events I experienced during my stay in Rarotonga were the Koka Lagoon Cruise, Te Vara Nui Village cultural show and Raro Buggy Tours. </p>

    <p><em><u><h3>Koka Lagoon Cruise:</h3></u></em>Based on Muri Beach in Rarotonga's Ngatangiia District, Koka operates a daily lagoon cruise on their glass bottom boat cruise through Muri Lagoon. They operate multiple activities like snorkelling at their marine reserve with giant clams, tropical fish and their friend 'Roger' the moray eel, cultural experience with coconut tree climbing demonstration and show and on board ukelele sing alongs on board. </p>

        <p><em><u><h3>Te Vara Nui Village:</h3></u></em> Rarotonga’s finest dancers and musicians perform to ‘The Legend of Tongaiti’ by flaming torchlight on floating and fixed stages of waterfall garden. This compelling story is of a voyaging warrior named Tongaiti who, with his family, goes in search of new land to call home. A story of pride, love and celebration. This over water show also includes Island/Western Fusion Buffet. Immerse in their local culture and embrace the Cook Islands Maori people through the "Legend of Tongaiti”. <p>

  <p><em><u><h3>Raro Buggy Tours:</h3></u></em> The Raro Buggy Tours drive through roads less traveled whilst experiencing the islands incredible beauty up close and personal as you maneuver with your personal buggy through hills and plantations. Also the tour goes through the abandoned 'Sheraton Hotel' which is half submerged by jungle and is inhabited by multiple animals. The hotel itself is left in ruins perfect for an off road adventure to get dirty! the journey then goes to Wigmores waterfall in the center of the island to clean off the mud and dirt.</p>

<p>Other than the attractions located around the island, the little things can be some fun activities for all to experience. From stand up paddleboarding in Muri Lagoon, to strolling the beach with up to 10 dogs and feasting upon the foods of this tropical culture.</p>
<p>For me personally I have never done stand up paddleboarding and for my first time I did it with a dog at the front of the board like a guide. Listening to the local sounds from song, the breaking of the ocean is something truly spectacular. The freshness of the food to the beauty of the nature which covers this tropical paradise is something I will never forget and Rarotonga is for sure an ideal place to experience these things.</p>
